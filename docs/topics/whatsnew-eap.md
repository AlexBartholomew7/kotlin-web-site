## How to update to the Kotlin 1.7.20-Beta

Install Kotlin 1.7.0-Beta in any of the following ways:

* If you use the _Early Access Preview_ update channel, the IDE will suggest automatically updating to 1.7.20-Beta as soon as it becomes available.
* If you use the _Stable_ update channel, you can change the channel to _Early Access Preview_ at any time by selecting **Tools** | **Kotlin** | **Configure Kotlin Plugin Updates** in your IDE.
  You’ll then be able to install the latest preview release.

Once you’ve installed 1.7.20-Beta, don’t forget to [change the Kotlin version](configure-build-for-eap.md) to 1.7.20-Beta in your build scripts.
